<br>

### Problem Statement  
In this problem, you will write a function that returns the count of a string’s suffix in a given string, `S`. A suffix is a combination of one or more symbols appended at the end of the string. You will be given the length, `L` of the suffix as a parameter to the function.

### Constraints
- `L` > 0
- `S` does not contain new line characters
- Length (`S`) > 0

<br>

### Sample Input 
> `et tu, brute`  
`1`

### Sample Output
> `2`

<br>

### Explanation  
- **Input**: Line 1 denotes the string with no newline characters and Line 2 denotes the length, `L` of the suffix
- **Output**: The suffix is ‘e’ and ‘e’ is present twice in string S, “et tu, brute”. Therefore, the count will be 2.
